\title{Visualise seasonal decomposition}
\usage{
ggsdc(data, mapping, frequency, method = c("stl", "decompose", "seas"), start,
  s.window, type = c("additive", "multiplicative"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataset to use for plot.}

\item{mapping}{List of aesthetic mappings.  Must include x and y, and optionally
can include colour/color}

\item{frequency}{frequency of the period of the time series eg 12 = monthly}

\item{method}{function to use for performing the seasonal decomposition. stl
and decompose are functions in the \code{stats} package; \code{seas} is access
to the \code{seats} program from X-13-SEATS-ARIMA via the \code{seasonal} package}

\item{start}{starting time for the data; only needed if \code{method = 'seas'}.}

\item{s.window}{parameter to pass to \code{stl()}}

\item{type}{parameter to pass to \code{decompose()}}
}
\description{
Creates a standard plot of seasonal decomposition with four facets

# sample time series data in data frame

      type = "multiplicative") +
   geom_line(colour = "blue", size = 2) +
   theme_light(8)

   labs(x = "", y = "Air passenger numbers") +
   geom_point()

      frequency = 12, start = c(1949, 1)) +
