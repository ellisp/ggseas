#' Seasonal decomposition on the fly
#' 
#' ggseas allows you to perform seasonal decomposition on the fly as part of a `ggplot2` pipeline.
#' 
#' Two main sets of functions are provided:
#' 
#' \itemize{
#'     \item{\code{stat_seas()}, \code{stat_stl()} and friends do seasonal adjustment, indexing, rolling averages and by default render a line geom.
#'     You can consider these as taking the place of \code{geom_line()} in the ggplot2 pipeline}
#'     \item{\code{ggsdc()} goes where \code{ggplot()} normally does (ie at the beginning of the pipeline) and creates a graphic with four facets for the original data, trend, seasonal and random components}
