#' This dataset was downloaded from \url{http://www.stats.govt.nz/infoshare/} and 
#' transformed in the following way:
#' 
#' \itemize{
#'   \item missing values were filtered out (ie of series that started later 
#'   than the longest series)
#'   \item a 'Balance' indicator variable was added for easier manipulation and filtering
#'   \item the single variable categorisation was split into two (Account
#'    and Category) to make it tidier.
